# Welcome to the Alaskan Astro How To Page

This page is a work in progress but I'll keep it live while it grows. 

## About

**This page exists with the goal of being a *one stop shop* for basic Astrophotography knowledge.**

There exist many useful resources for AP across the internet but it can be hard to know where to go next. While I won't claim to always have flawless information I will do my best to report and cite the best I can. 

This hobby has a wonderful practice of freely sharing information and I hope to help pay that back with this resource.
